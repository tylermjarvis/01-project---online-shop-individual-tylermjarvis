    body: `## Deciding on what to sell

Choose the type of product you want to sell on your online shop. Think about how you will source content and images. Once you have decided what you will sell, move onto the rest of this issue.
    
## Understanding the project

Read through each of the GitHub issues in the To Do column. For every ticket, ensure you understand what is being asked of you. It is your responsibility to ensure you understand every ticket.

Feel free to pull in an instructor if the requirements are not clear. It's vital that you understand what is being asked of you.

In particular, identify if any tickets depend on each other. For example, you need to create a Stripe account before you can add products to the Stripe account.

## How to work on issues

Now you know what the project is, and what items you will be selling, it's time to get started.

The backlog is in priority order. You should complete the issues at the top of the column before starting any more issues. Never start a new issue before completing the previous issue. That means you should **never** have more than one issue in progress at a time.

In summary:

- You should only ever be working on one issue at a time
- Finish an issue before starting a new issue
- Start with the issues at the top of the column first. Do not re-prioritise them.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] You know what product you are selling
- [ ] You have one issue _In Progress_`,

    title: "Team formation",
    body: `You will be designing wireframes as a team. An important part of being in a team is agreeing on your working agreements - how will you work with your team and ensure everyone feels comfortable to participate?
    
Part of this team formation exercise will include applying knowledge from the Treaty of Waitangi.

The [Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi – ngā mātāpono o te tiriti](https://teara.govt.nz/en/principles-of-the-treaty-of-waitangi-nga-matapono-o-te-tiriti) should be applied to how your team works together for this project.

### Participation

Acknowledges sovereignty/governance. Ensure there is equal participation for each member of your team. Ensure everyone has input into decisions that directly affect them. Decide how you will ensure that each team member has equal participation. For example, a working agreement that ensures all members of the team get a chance to show their design in turn.

### Protection

Acknowledges the protection of rights, benefits and, possessions. Each of your team members should have their Tikanga (culture and protocols) and Taonga (treasures) such as Te Reo Māori respected and given equal footing to the Tikanga and Taonga of other cultures. For example, you might run a morning prayer or Karakia, a standup, or other Tikanga.

### Partnership

Acknowledges sovereignty/governance and working together with the same rights and benefits as subjects of the Crown. This can be applied to your team by working together in partnership. Each team member should have a say in how the team performs. If you are making a decision that affects other people, they should have a say in the decision. For example, each member of the team gets to discuss the pros and cons of a design decision.

## Working agreements

Taking the above principles into consideration, with your team, brainstorm five working agreements that your team will follow.

Write down your working agreements in the \`WORKING_AGREEMENTS.md\` file, and explain what they mean, and how they reflect the principals from the Treaty of Waitangi, such as partnership, participation, and protection. 

## Acceptance Criteria

\`WORKING_AGREEMENTS.md\` file exists in the project, and includes the following:

- [ ] List of at least 5 agreements.
- [ ] Document how the actions reflect the principles from the Treaty of Waitangi, such as partnership, participation, and protection`,
