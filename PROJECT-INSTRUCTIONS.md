## Brief

Your team has been tasked with completing an eCommerce shop. You will need to set up the shop, create products and integrate your React Application with a third party platform. You also need to complete some new features for the online store.

## Rationale

- Learn how to work in a team on the same product by following industry-standard development practices
- Apply the knowledge you have learnt so far to build a feature for an existing product

## Project handover

Watch the following handover from another developer to your team. This video explains the codebase you will be working in, and where to find the files you will be working on.
